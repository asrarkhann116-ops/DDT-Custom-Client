## 📌 Overview

**GPU Binder** is a Vencord plugin that forces Discord to use a specific GPU preference:

- 🚀 High Performance (Discrete GPU)
- 🔋 Power Saving (Integrated GPU)
- ⚙️ System Default (Let Windows decide)

Discord updates change the installation folder path (e.g., app-1.0.x), causing Windows to treat it as a new application and lose your previously assigned GPU preferences. This plugin automatically detects the new path and re-links your settings.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> This plugin modifies the Windows Registry (`HKCU`).
> It overrides any GPU preference set manually via:
>
> `Windows → System → Display → Graphics → Discord`

## 🖥 Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Vencord installed **from source** (locally built)
- `pnpm` installed

> Installer builds of Vencord are not supported.

## 🔧 How It Works

The plugin:
- Detects the current `Discord.exe` path automatically on every startup.
- Edits the registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DirectX\UserGpuPreferences`.
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Scans for and removes stale registry entries from previous Discord versions (e.g., old `app-1.0.xxxx` folders) to keep your registry clean.
- Re-applies your preferred setting if a Discord update changes the executable path.

No background services.  
No telemetry.  
No scheduled tasks.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Settings not applying?** Make sure to **fully quit** Discord (from the system tray) and restart it. A simple `Ctrl + R` is not enough for native registry changes to take effect.

## ❗ Important Notes
